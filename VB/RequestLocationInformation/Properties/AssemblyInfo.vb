' How to get information about a geographical point using the Microsoft Bing Geocode web service
' 
' This example demonstrates how to obtain information about a geographical point
' from the Bing Geocode web service.
' 
' To see how it works, do one of the
' following:
' - locate a desired geographical point on a map and click it;
' or
' -
' specify coordinates of a geographical point in Latitude and Longitude text boxes
' and then click the Request Location Information button.
' 
' After that the
' coordinates of the current geographical point are passed to the
' BingGeocodeDataProvider.RequestLocationInformation
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapBingGeocodeDataProvider_RequestLocationInformationtopic)method.
' Results contain an address (LocationInformation.Address
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapLocationInformation_Addresstopic)),
' the entity type (LocationInformation.EntityType
